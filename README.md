# Neural-Network-Models
Various neural network models and Evaluation techniques implemented in scratch via Python.

The list includes:
1. Single Perceptron model for AND Gate designing
2. Single Perceptron model for linearly separable IRIS dataset with two classes
3. Single Perceptron model for non-linearly separable IRIS dataset with 3 classes. One vs One technique is utilised here.
4. Multi-Layer Perceptron for MNIST dataset
5. Convolution Neural Network for CIFAR dataset
